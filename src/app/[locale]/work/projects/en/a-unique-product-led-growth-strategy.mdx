## Overview

I developed and executed a product-led growth strategy at Azibo that established association partnerships as a high-performing new channel. By modernizing and digitizing the core benefits provided by leading real estate associations (such as RHAWA, the largest in Washington), I transformed a static, time-consuming process into a seamless, value-added experience—driving significant user growth and profitability.
## Problem and opportunity

Azibo needed to diversify growth channels beyond paid search and identified real estate associations as an untapped opportunity. These associations lacked modern digital solutions, which risks leading to member churn over time.

## Solution & key contributions

- **Forms Library**: I designed and built a dynamic forms library that replaced outdated static PDF workflows on association websites, channeling members directly into Azibo.
- **Novi Integration**: By integrating with the Associations’ CRM (Novi), I ensured a frictionless signup experience, automatically granting members access to Azibo’s platform.
- **E-Sign Product**: I led the creation of a rules-based template system that leveraged property data to pre-select and pre-fill lease documents. This innovation dramatically reduced time and effort for landlords, increasing adoption and satisfaction.
- **Guardrail Features**: I introduced automated safeguards, including default values, validations, and contextual helper text. These features not only minimized legal risks for members but also strengthened the association’s brand and perceived value by attributing these to the association.
- **Business Development & GTM Strategy**: I orchestrated partnerships end-to-end—from identifying key associations and negotiating agreements to designing and implementing a scalable go-to-market playbook.
- **Team Empowerment**: After initially digitizing key association forms myself, I developed training programs and documentation that enabled a team to maintain and scale these efforts across multiple associations.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was getting the association members to utilize the remainder of the Azibo platform. We overcame this by:

- **GTM strategy**: Iterating and adding co-hosted webinars, and email sequences to drive adoption.
- **First-time user experience**: Focusing on making it frictionless for members.
- **Quality of life features**: Continuing to add features that assoications would want to promote to their members.

## Outcome

- **#1 Growth Channel**: The association partnerships channel quickly became Azibo’s top source of new users and units.
- **Profitability & Efficiency**: These partnerships delivered higher-margin users with lower acquisition costs than any other channel.
- **Market Expansion**: After the initial success with RHAWA, my strategy scaled to major associations in California and Washington, cementing Azibo’s presence in key markets and forging a blueprint for future partnerships.

In summary, my product-led growth strategy not only opened a major new growth avenue for Azibo but also delivered superior customer experiences, increased profitability, and scalable growth that continues to fuel the company’s success.
