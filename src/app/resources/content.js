    <br/> Here are some highlights from my career:<br/><br/>
    - Led as a player-coach while scaling Azibo from few thousand users to 20k+, expanding from 1 to 7 products, and improving margins 61 points.<br/>
    - Developed and executed a unique product led growth strategy that became Azibo's primary growth channel and most profitable user segment.<br/>
    - Scaled loan servicing at Upstart from 10s of thousands to 100s of thousands of loans, and 100s of millions of monthly payments with minimal team growth by leveraging automation and workflow efficiency improvements.<br/>
